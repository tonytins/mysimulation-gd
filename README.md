My Simulation is a life simulation game inspired by The Sims, built using the Godot game engine. I've always been a huge fan of The Sims and always wanted to create my own life simulation game. I decided to use Godot as the game engine with Kagenashi's behavior tree AI architecture to mimic the one used in The Sims to give the game a similar feel. I don't know how successful I'll be, but we'll see where it goes.
